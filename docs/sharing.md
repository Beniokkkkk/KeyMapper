## How to use Key Mapper threads

The main intent behind Key Mapper Discussions is to provide users an easy way to share their key maps without them
getting lost in the Discord chat, or any other subtle inconvenience.

### Key map sharing threads

Please note that some off-topic discussions aside from help threads may not get responses from Key Mapper
volunteers.<br>

### Help threads

Once again, note that some off-topic discussions aside from help threads may not get responses from Key Mapper
volunteers.<br>
The help threads are for users who are having a hard time understanding how something works, or they Just because you
mention someone (using the prefix ```@``` before a user's name) does not mean they will respond. Some may never respond
to you if you mention them too many times.
